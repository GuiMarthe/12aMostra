[These slides](https://mlime.github.io/files/introduction-recurrent-neural.pdf) were created for the "12ª aMostra", an event organized by the undergrad students in statistics at the University of São Paulo. We ([Antonio](https://github.com/Abello966) and [Felipe](https://github.com/felipessalvatore)) try to
explain some basic topics of deep learning such as: computational graphs, deep feedforward networks, back-propagation and convolutional neural networks. The slides are in Portuguese.

## Usage

You can find the pdf of the presentation in the folder /src/pdf. But if you want to compile the latex file just run:
